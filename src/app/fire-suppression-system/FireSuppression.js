          <p>The gold standard for protecting electronics and irreplaceable assets. Clean agent systems use safe, non-toxic gases that extinguish a fire by absorbing heat and interrupting the chemical reaction at a molecular level. These agents are electrically non-conductive and evaporate instantly, leaving absolutely zero residue. This means your operations can be back up and running almost immediately after an event, with no costly cleanup or water damage to your sensitive equipment.

          <p>
         A highly effective and fast-acting solution for unmanned industrial applications. A high-pressure CO2 system works by rapidly displacing oxygen in a protected area, effectively smothering a fire. As an inert gas, CO2 is highly effective on Class B (flammable liquid) and Class C (electrical) fires. Due to the life-safety risks associated with oxygen displacement, these systems are only suitable for enclosed, unoccupied areas and are equipped with extensive safety and warning mechanisms.

          <p>

        Commercial kitchens are one of the highest-risk environments for fires, specifically Class K fires involving cooking oils and fats. Water is ineffective and dangerous on these types of fires. Our specialized kitchen suppression systems are installed directly within the kitchen hood and are designed to automatically detect a fire. Upon activation, they discharge a proprietary wet chemical agent that smothers the flames and reacts with the cooking oils in a process called saponification, creating a thick, soapy foam that prevents re-ignition.
