It instantly knocks down the flames and then begins a chemical reaction with the hot grease called saponification. This reaction creates a thick, soap-like foam blanket over the entire cooking surface.

                <p className=" text-sm text-gray-700 text-justify ">
                  A commercial kitchen is the engine room of any hospitality
                  business—a high-pressure environment of intense heat,
                  flammable cooking oils, and a constant flurry of activity.
                  Within this unique setting, the risk of fire is exceptionally
                  high. A simple moment of inattention over a deep-fat fryer or
                  a gas range can lead to a fire that ignites in seconds and
                  spreads with terrifying speed. Standard fire extinguishers are
                  often no match for a fast-moving grease fire, which can easily
                  re-ignite. Adhunik FireXpert provides advanced, automatic
                  Kitchen Fire Suppression Systems, specifically engineered to
                  combat the unique hazards of commercial kitchens across Delhi,
                  Gurgaon, and Noida.

                    Fires that originate on cooking appliances are fundamentally

                    cooking oils, and fats at extremely high temperatures.
                    Ignoring this specific risk can have devastating
                    consequences for your business.
